# Sudoku-Solver-in-java-
ðŸ§© Problem Statement:

Write a program to solve a Sudoku puzzle by filling the empty cells.
A Sudoku solution must satisfy all constraints:

Each row must contain digits 1â€“9 without repetition.

Each column must contain digits 1â€“9 without repetition.

Each of the 9 sub-boxes (3Ã—3) must also contain digits 1â€“9.


The input board is partially filled, where empty cells are represented by '.'.

Example Input:

[
  ["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
  ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
  [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
  ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
  ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
  ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
  [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
  [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
  [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]
]

ðŸ’¡ Approach (Backtracking):

1. Traverse the grid to find an empty cell (.).


2. Try filling it with numbers 1â€“9.


3. Check if the placement is valid:

Same number not in same row, column, or 3Ã—3 subgrid.



4. If valid â†’ recursively try to solve the rest of the board.


5. If no number works â†’ backtrack (reset the cell to '.').
